# React native app with expo launcher ðŸ‘‹

This app has three screens

- Home
- User list
- User detail

The data is fetch from the API in [`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Run tests

   ```bash
    npm run test
   ```

## Info

State management with react context to store users and don't make more request than neccessary
I have used some components and hooks that the expo template provides (the ones outside the app folder)
